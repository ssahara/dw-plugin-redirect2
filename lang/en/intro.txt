====== Redirect Configuration ======

**RedirectPage** ...
Map old page to new one. Both of //old-pagename// and //new-pagename// must be 
absolute and cleaned (no specialchars, all lowercase, full namespaces).
The //new-pagename// may contain anchor hash (#).

**RedirectMatch** ...
Redirection using a regular expression used (instead of simple prefix matching) 
if the first field enclosed in '%' marks. The supplied regular expression is 
matched against the URL-path, and if it matches, 
this plugin will substitute any parenthesized matches into the given string
and use it as a new URL-path.

# Example:
pagename      ns:page#headline     # redirect to the anchor in other page
ns:somepage   http://example.com   # redirect to external url
%ns1:(.*)%    ns2:$1               # (RedirectMatch) based on a regular expression match
